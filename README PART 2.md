> **An HTML boilerplate is a set of pre-written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that form the
starting point for your web project. It includes essential elements like the doctype
declaration, meta tags, link to CSS files, and script tags for JavaScript.**


### **1.Components of HTML Boilerplate**
*An HTML Boilerplate typically includes the following components:*
* **HTML**: The fundamental markup language used to structure the content of a website.
* **CSS**: The language used for styling and layout of a website, enhancing the visual
presentation. This is optional but commonly included.
* **JavaScript**: A programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to a
website. This is also optional but widely used.


### **2.Essential Elements of an HTML Boilerplate**
*Table of Content*:-
1.  Doctype Declaration
2. Head Section
3. Body Section
 
*Examples*:
 ##### **Doctype Declaration:**
* The doctype declaration is crucial as it tells the browser which version of HTML you are
using. The most common doctype for modern web development is **HTML5**:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

##### **Head Section:**
* The ***<head>*** section contains meta-information about the document, such as the character
set, viewport settings, and links to CSS files:


``` Javascript <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Jassim Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head> 
```


##### **Body Section:**
* The ***<body>*** section contains the content of your website. This is where you'll place your
HTML elements that will be visible to users:

 ``` Javascript <body>
    <header> 
        <h1>Welcome World</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is main contant.</p>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p> Jassim Project 2024</p>
    </footer>
    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
</body>
